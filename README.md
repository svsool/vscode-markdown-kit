# Markdown Kit

Collection of commands and utilities for managing Markdown notes in VSCode.

These utils were originally thought to be part of [Memo](https://github.com/svsool/vscode-memo), but I hope the community will find them useful standalone.

It was hard to find a similar extension working on Mac. It also works on Windows and Linux (via xclip).
